## README Visual Examples

- **BG removal demos: ALWAYS use WHITE background** — white has zero color overlap with any colorful illustration. Black bg is risky: dark feather/fur/shadow details near edges are close to black threshold, flood fill nibbles them. Three iterations proved this. Current showcase: colorful owl on white bg.
- Comparison images built with `/tmp/rebuild_readme_examples.py` pattern: Pillow checker-bg composites, side-by-side panels, labeled with `find_font()` Menlo fallback.
- Composite example (#4) reuses the bg-removal cutout — if #1 looks bad, #4 cascades.
